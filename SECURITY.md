# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability or issue, please **open a new GitHub Issue** using the `bug` or `security` label, and describe the problem clearly.

We believe in transparency and collaboration, so **security issues may be discussed publicly** unless there's a risk of active exploitation.

If you prefer to report privately (e.g., critical or exploitable vulnerabilities), you can email us at: `your_email@domain.com`.

Please include:
- A clear description of the issue.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Your proposed mitigation if available.

## Coordinated Disclosure

If you report a critical issue privately, we will:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
- Investigate and respond promptly.
- Credit you in the changelog if the fix is published.
